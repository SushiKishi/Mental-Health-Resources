# Sources, Footnotes, Thanks, etc.:

The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides a [list of mental health resources](https://www.cdc.gov/mental-health/caring/index.html), many of which were re-listed here.

Lucio Paiva created a TOC Generator you can find [here](https://luciopaiva.com/markdown-toc/) which generates the table of contents at the top of the document. Thank you!


# To-Do:

* Find resources for people who don't live in the US.
* Add more resources than the handful I already knew of previously
